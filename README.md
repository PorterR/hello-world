That is my favorite robot song. It was written by Rusty Oilcan back when oil was still a resource. Poor Rusty Oilcan... He had no use after vehicles began using electricity. 

He spent a breif period of time working as a fluffer on the set of "Stroke my Bolts and Screw my Nutz," but quickly lost interest after a Tronstar blew its load peppering shrapnel in Rusty Oilcan's face.
